**NOTICE:** This plugin branch is for PocketMine-MP 4. If you are looking for the PocketMine-MP 3 version of this plugin, please visit the [main](https://github.com/KygekTeam/KygekClearConsole/tree/main) branch.

A PocketMine-MP plugin to clear server console using command. This plugin is roughly equivalent to `cls` command on Windows or `clear` command on Linux.

This plugin is not planned to be released on Poggit, because it may break Rule A1 or A2 (see [Poggit Rules](https://poggit.pmmp.io/rules.edit) for more information, and remember to use common sense!).

## ‚ùî How Does This Plugin Works

This plugin clears the console when the `clearconsole` command (Alias: `cc`) gets executed. This plugin prints `\e[H\e[J` character to console to clear the console. This plugin ensures the command will only show and work on console by using `CommandEvent` to capture the command and cancelling the event to prevent unexpected outputs (e.g. Unknown command) if the sender is from the console.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Only works in console
- Command gets hidden in command suggestions and help page (Player)
- Sends unknown command message whenever a player tries to execute the command
- API to clear the console (`ClearConsole::clear()`)
